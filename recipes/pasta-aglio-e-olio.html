            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p><li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li></p>
                    <p><li>1/2 cup of olive oil</li></p>
                    <p><li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li></p>
                    <p><li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li></p>
                    <p><li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li></p>
                    <p><li>Optional: 1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li></p>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <p><li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li></p>
                    <p><li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley; toss until combined.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Optional: Serve pasta topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li></p>
                </ol>
